# Changelog

All notable changes to sem are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- SQL support (`.sql`, `.psql`, `.pgsql`, `.ddl`) via the official DerekStride/tree-sitter-sql grammar. Extracts tables, views, materialized views, functions, indexes, types, schemas, triggers, sequences, and databases. Thanks @robahtou for the request (#339).
- Start tracking project changes in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Add a pull request check that asks contributors to include a changelog entry.
- `sem entities` accepts multiple file or directory path arguments.

### Changed

- Cloud sync only auto-registers repos that GitHub confirms are public. Private repos run locally unless you opt in with `SEM_SYNC_PRIVATE=1`.
- `install.sh` verifies the release archive against `checksums.txt` before installing.
- Switched the Perl grammar to the official `ts-parser-perl` crate (was the unattributed `tree-sitter-perl-next` copy). Properly attributed, correctly MIT-licensed, and includes upstream fixes: an infinite-loop hang on malformed input, better error recovery, and faster parsing. Thanks @rabbiveesh for the report (#355).
