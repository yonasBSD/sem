# Changelog

All notable changes to sem are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- While the spinner is up, sem shows a rotating one-line tip about another useful command underneath it, like the hints under Claude Code's spinner. `sem diff` (the most-used command) now shows the spinner during its compute, so you learn about `sem impact`, `sem context`, `sem blame`, the MCP server, etc. while you wait. Strictly stderr and TTY-only, so it never touches output, pipes, JSON, or agent sessions, and disappears when the work finishes. Disable with `SEM_NO_PROGRESS=1`.
- The MCP server (`sem mcp`) now keeps its in-memory entity graph live with a background file watcher. Previously `sem_impact` and `sem_context` re-walked and re-stat'd the entire repo on every call just to check whether the cached graph was still fresh, which on a large repo is real per-call overhead. A watcher now tracks filesystem changes, so calls where nothing changed return the cached graph instantly (no walk, no stat), and an edit triggers an incremental rebuild of only the changed files. Your uncommitted edits are reflected without restarting the server. Disable with `SEM_NO_WATCH=1`.

### Changed

- Graph resolution now uses faster hash collections in hot paths to reduce graph build overhead.
- Scope resolution caches repeated reference lookups during graph builds to reduce redundant resolver work.
- Graph builds avoid retaining import scan source text after import extraction, reducing peak memory use.
- `sem context` now prints the full source of the target entity in the terminal. It previously showed only the first line, so reading a function meant falling back to `--json`. Related entities still show a one-line signature so the context map stays scannable.
- `sem context` and `sem impact` (CLI and the `sem_context` / `sem_impact` MCP tools) now accept `Class.method` (and `Outer.Inner.method`) to address a method by name, not only the bare method name or a full entity id.

### Fixed

- Fixed: `super::module::func()` calls were dropped from the entity graph, so `impact` and `context` under-reported the blast radius across modules. Multi-segment Rust path-prefixed calls (`super::`/`crate::`/`self::`) now resolve to the real entity.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- `sem impact` now shows the uv-style progress spinner during the cold graph build (it's the most-used graph command). Same stderr/TTY gating as `graph` and `context`.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- Progress spinner for slow graph builds. `sem graph` and `sem context` now show a uv-style spinner and a summary line (e.g. `135,298 entities, 7,743 files in 6.6s`) while building the entity graph. Strictly stderr and TTY-only, so pipes, JSON, and agent/MCP sessions are unaffected. Disable with SEM_NO_PROGRESS=1.

- SQL support (`.sql`, `.psql`, `.pgsql`, `.ddl`) via the official DerekStride/tree-sitter-sql grammar. Extracts tables, views, materialized views, functions, indexes, types, schemas, triggers, sequences, and databases. Thanks @robahtou for the request (#339).
- Start tracking project changes in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Add a pull request check that asks contributors to include a changelog entry.
- `sem entities` accepts multiple file or directory path arguments.

### Changed

- Sparse checkouts now work. libgit2 cannot read a sparse index (`unsupported mandatory extension: 'sdir'`) and its workdir diff reported sparse-excluded files as deleted; sem now routes working and staged diffs through the git CLI when a sparse checkout is detected. Thanks for the report (#330).

- README now documents adding the MCP server to coding agents (`claude mcp add sem -- sem mcp`) and explains why `sem mcp` exists. The old section pointed at a separate `sem-mcp` binary; `sem mcp` ships in the main binary.

- `sem stats` now counts every diff, including runs that find no changes (previously those returned early and were never recorded, so `diffs performed` undercounted).

- Telemetry no longer records development builds (debug builds, or binaries run from a Cargo `target/` directory), so contributor and CI-of-our-own usage stays out of the numbers.

- Cloud sync only auto-registers repos that GitHub confirms are public. Private repos run locally unless you opt in with `SEM_SYNC_PRIVATE=1`.
- `install.sh` verifies the release archive against `checksums.txt` before installing.
- Switched the Perl grammar to the official `ts-parser-perl` crate (was the unattributed `tree-sitter-perl-next` copy). Properly attributed, correctly MIT-licensed, and includes upstream fixes: an infinite-loop hang on malformed input, better error recovery, and faster parsing. Thanks @rabbiveesh for the report (#355).

### Removed

- `sem verify` (function call-arity checker). It saw negligible use and overlapped with compilers/LSPs; removing it keeps the surface area focused.
