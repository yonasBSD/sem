# Changelog

All notable changes to sem are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Graph resolution now uses faster hash collections in hot paths to reduce graph build overhead.
- Scope resolution caches repeated reference lookups during graph builds to reduce redundant resolver work.
- Graph builds avoid retaining import scan source text after import extraction, reducing peak memory use.

### Fixed

- Fixed: `super::module::func()` calls were dropped from the entity graph, so `impact` and `context` under-reported the blast radius across modules. Multi-segment Rust path-prefixed calls (`super::`/`crate::`/`self::`) now resolve to the real entity.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- `sem impact` now shows the uv-style progress spinner during the cold graph build (it's the most-used graph command). Same stderr/TTY gating as `graph` and `context`.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- Progress spinner for slow graph builds. `sem graph` and `sem context` now show a uv-style spinner and a summary line (e.g. `135,298 entities, 7,743 files in 6.6s`) while building the entity graph. Strictly stderr and TTY-only, so pipes, JSON, and agent/MCP sessions are unaffected. Disable with SEM_NO_PROGRESS=1.

- SQL support (`.sql`, `.psql`, `.pgsql`, `.ddl`) via the official DerekStride/tree-sitter-sql grammar. Extracts tables, views, materialized views, functions, indexes, types, schemas, triggers, sequences, and databases. Thanks @robahtou for the request (#339).
- Start tracking project changes in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Add a pull request check that asks contributors to include a changelog entry.
- `sem entities` accepts multiple file or directory path arguments.

### Changed

- Sparse checkouts now work. libgit2 cannot read a sparse index (`unsupported mandatory extension: 'sdir'`) and its workdir diff reported sparse-excluded files as deleted; sem now routes working and staged diffs through the git CLI when a sparse checkout is detected. Thanks for the report (#330).

- README now documents adding the MCP server to coding agents (`claude mcp add sem -- sem mcp`) and explains why `sem mcp` exists. The old section pointed at a separate `sem-mcp` binary; `sem mcp` ships in the main binary.

- `sem stats` now counts every diff, including runs that find no changes (previously those returned early and were never recorded, so `diffs performed` undercounted).

- Telemetry no longer records development builds (debug builds, or binaries run from a Cargo `target/` directory), so contributor and CI-of-our-own usage stays out of the numbers.

- Cloud sync only auto-registers repos that GitHub confirms are public. Private repos run locally unless you opt in with `SEM_SYNC_PRIVATE=1`.
- `install.sh` verifies the release archive against `checksums.txt` before installing.
- Switched the Perl grammar to the official `ts-parser-perl` crate (was the unattributed `tree-sitter-perl-next` copy). Properly attributed, correctly MIT-licensed, and includes upstream fixes: an infinite-loop hang on malformed input, better error recovery, and faster parsing. Thanks @rabbiveesh for the report (#355).

### Removed

- `sem verify` (function call-arity checker). It saw negligible use and overlapped with compilers/LSPs; removing it keeps the surface area focused.
